# Scrape-and-Drape

Scrape and drape is likely not the name that this project will keep forever but will live on forever in the .git folder where no one will see it

This project exists to parse through (Sorry Shannon!) weirdly formatted html and provide an interface for higher ups (lol) to analyze various parts of the data logged on our server

Addendum: Scrape and drape is a dumb word association that I've backronymned to mean 

Scrape
